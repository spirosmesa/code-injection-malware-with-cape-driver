# Reports 

This directory contains all the samples as well as the results of the analysis after executing these samples.
Every sub-directory represents one subset (one year) of the complete set, and has the following structure:

- `year`
  - `drakvuf-logs`: The location for the raw execution traces.
  - `samples`: Information about the sample selection.
  - `summaries`: The log files containing all the samples and their detected injection technique.

Note that some directories will contain multiple summary log files.
This was done because some executions were ran in batches rather than one single run.
It is safe to just concatenate every file together and treat the files as one big result.

In case you are interested in the raw execution traces, they are not included in this repository but can be downloaded separately [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13cvUI2MpKlZmcsqW1177BzVSFJSQ2ZNi?usp=sharing).
